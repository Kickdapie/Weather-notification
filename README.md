# Weather-notification
Get tired of checking the weather every morning? Have a notification every time you turn on your computer to make things simpler.

Download the code and replace the API Key with your own. I used [freeWeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) for my program but there are many API's available for you to use (don't forget to change the url for it however).

On Windows:
- Open up notepad and write in it:
  python path_to_your_script.py
Remember to put the correct path by replacing path_to_your_script
- Name the notepad run_weather.bat
- Press Windows + R and type shell:startup in the popup
- Place run_weather.bat in the startup folder
